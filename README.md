# MidiPlayer
Simple, midi-based, music playing application

The idea behind this application was to crate a way for guitar/bass players to be albe to apply their knowledg of music scales
to playing an virtual instrument (they placement of notes on the 4 NotePane rows corresponds to their placement on a sringed instrument
that's tuned "in fourths")
